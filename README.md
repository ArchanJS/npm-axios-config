# Axios-Config (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-config)

## A npm package for Reactjs, to handle config variables while making any request using axios.

## About axios-config:
    This function takes two arguments. The first one is the type of the
    config variable user want. If user wants to pass a bearer token, then
    he or she must have to pass "privBearerConfig" as the first argument
    and the "token" as the second argument. Else the user will get a simple
    config variable that can be used for login or registration.

## How to install?
    Open the terminal. Just type "npm i axios-config" and hit enter.
